This project Includes: 
1. Code
2. Logic
3. Constraint
4. Flowchart

1. Code is in the org.bingo.main package.

	- Program will be runnable using Housie.java File, which includes main method
	- This code includes 2 objects.
	1. Player object -> To create instance of player and associate ticket with it. Also contains functions to check winning Combination
	2. Ticket object -> To create instance of ticket and function to generate random numbers in ticket.
	-> Necessary comments

2. Logic:

	-> User will be able to
		- Give the range of numbers to generate random numbers
		- Give Number of Players
		- Give size of ticket
		- Give maximum number in each row
		- First N number to winning combination
	-> Loop over each players
		- Create a ticket
		- Fill up ticket with random numbers
		- Create player and associate player with the created ticket
	-> Caller will call the number
	-> Beginning of the game full housie flag set as false
	-> caller will call the number (random number) and check in list if exists or not
	-> if not
		- iterate over each player and check any of given winning combination
	-> if yes
		- continue and generate another number which wasn't called before
	-> Declare winning type.

3. Following constraints are consider in the project:
	-> Based on given number of players, they will be assigned as playerId(unique)
	-> Tickets are generated with random numbers and empty space as 0.(each ticket has a unique ticketId).
	-> While calling the number (during game), 0 can not be valid number as housie starts from 1 ..n.
	-> Once any player win any of the winning combination (EarlyN, TopLine), then other player can't win the same.
	-> If there is a full housie, game will stop.

4. Flowchart
 
	-> Flowchart is under Flowchart folder and it contains image.
